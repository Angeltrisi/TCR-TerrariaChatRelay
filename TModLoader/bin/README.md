# TModLoader Configuration
You have to options to configure your TerrariaChatRelay plugin.
- TerrariaChatRelay_Config.json -> Built-in ModConfig system with links, guidance, and a visual editor
- TerrariaChatRelay/TerrariaChatRelay-Discord.json -> Text editor
Note: Your plugin will use the **the newest file** with the most recent changes. If you make a change in your ModConfig, it will overwrite the other file.
